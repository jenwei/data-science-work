# Learning outcomes
**Core** outcomes are topics I will adjust the course to ensure we cover.
**Bonus** topics are those I will cover if we have bonus time.

By the end of this course, students will be able to...

## (Setup)

Core
- install Rstudio and other data science packages
- load packages to access useful functions
- access documentation to use R functions
- access vignettes to learn new functions
- use Rstudio shortcuts to improve productivity

## (Data)

Core
- Isolate
  - data using `filter`
  - variables using `select`
- Derive
  - new variables with `mutate`
  - summaries with `group_by` and `summarize`
  - string matches with regular expressions
- Tidy
  - by reshaping with `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`
  - by `separate` and `unite` of columns
  - by `join` of multiple tables
- Load
  - data from a flat file (e.g. .csv)
  - data from googlesheets
  - data messy data (e.g. a nasty excel file)
- Liberate
  - data from images with WebPlotDigitizer
  - data from printed tables with Tabula

Bonus
- Derive
  - (window functions)
- Specialty
  - (lubridate)
  - (stringr)
  - (forcats)

## (Visualization)

Core
- State the basic components of the *grammar of graphics*: geometry, aesthetics,
  theme, layers
- Create
  - bar charts
  - histograms
  - boxplots
  - scatterplots
  - line plots
  - EDA-quality graphics
  - presentation-ready graphics
- Criticize
  - data visualizations based on *the visual hierarchy*
  - data visualizations based on their intended audience

Bonus
- (Geospatial with sf)
- (Shiny apps)
- (Leaflet maps)

## (Statistical Literacy)

Core
- Describe
  - the difference between variability and uncertainty
  - the difference between error and uncertainty
  - a dataset with descriptive statistics (mean, quantiles, correlations)
  - a random quantity with a distribution
  - the relationship between variables using a model
  - a future outcome using a fitted model
- Apply
  - the principles of curiosity and skepticism to perform EDA
- Quantify
  - the degree of uncertainty in an estimate
  - the degree of uncertainty in a prediction
  - testing and training error (e.g. via cross-validation)
- Fit
  - a distribution
  - a linear model
- Question
  - whether a given numerical result relates to a qualitative conclusion
  - whether a given degree of certainty is sufficient to make a decision
  - whether a given study has sufficient relevance to a given question
  - whether a model is flexible enough to fit a given dataset

Bonus
- Fit
  - a gaussian process
  - a random forest
- Select
  - features based on an appropriate error estimate
  - hyperparameters based on an appropriate error estimate

## (Communication)
- write easily-readable code by following a styleguide
- tell a story using the ABT framework
- judge a data story using the ABT framework

## (Reproducibility)

Core
- (Git)
- (Command line)
- (File hygiene)
- (Directory structuring)
