# Exercises

These are the daily exercises in the data science curriculum. These are meant to
be assigned and completed frequently. Exercises introduce simple concepts and
build slowly, and are ordered to interleave concepts.

## Build assignments and solutions

This directory contains the `master` files; to build the `assignment` and
`solution` files, run `> make` in this directory. The default target is to
produce `assignment` files for students, and `solution` files for release after
assignments are submitted.
